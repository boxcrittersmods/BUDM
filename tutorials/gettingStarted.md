# Getting Started
To get started you need to first require UPI in your userscript header
```js
// @require      https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/boxcrittersmods/UPI@latest/dist/UPI.min.js
```

Once you have done that you will also need to setup the configoration of UPI also in the userscript header. (`.abbrev` is optional)
```js
// UPI.id        simpleMod
// UPI.abbrev    SM
```

Then you'll need to decide weather you want to create a module or a mod
